    "pattern": "Present participle (-ing) density — three or more sentences in a paragraph using present participle phrases for analysis or description: 'highlighting X,' 'underscoring Y,' 'reflecting Z,' 'cultivating A,' 'encompassing B'",
    "why": "AI uses -ing phrases as an analysis shortcut — they add fake depth by implying ongoing significance without committing to a concrete claim. One or two per section is fine; three or more in a paragraph signals AI packing in pseudo-analytical filler.",
    "fix": "Convert most -ing analysis phrases to direct statements with concrete verbs. 'This highlights the gap' becomes 'The gap is clear.' 'Reflecting broader trends' becomes 'The same thing is happening across the industry.' Max one -ing analysis phrase per paragraph.",
