**Analyzed:** 915 comments

## Winning Architecture
To match the top-performing comments in your niche, your response should look like this:

### 1. Length & Depth
- **Target Length:** ~44 words.
- **Structure:** Use approximately 3 short paragraphs (spacing is key).

### 2. Formatting Elements
- **Micro-Paragraphs:** Break text frequently. Visual ease of reading is critical.

### 3. Voice & Tone Patterns
- **Objective/Direct:** Low usage of 'I'. State facts directly.

[Direct Truth/Hook]

[Explanation or "The Why" in 1-2 sentences]

[Closing Action or Summary]
```
