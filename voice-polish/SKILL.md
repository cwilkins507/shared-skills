# Voice Polish

Apply writing patterns and humanization rules to make content sound like a confident practitioner, not an AI or a textbook.

## When to Use

- Blog posts or articles that feel flat, smooth, or AI-generated
- Long-form content lacking rhythm variation or momentum
- Drafts that need quotable one-liners and stronger transitions
- Any content that should sound like a mentor talking to a peer

## Writing Patterns to Apply

### Voice & Rhythm (exm7777 Long-Form Patterns)

- **Momentum transitions:** Every section ends by pulling into the next. Never let the reader stop. Structure: `[summary of what you've achieved] -> but [gap that still exists] -> [next step fills the gap]`
- **"Most people get this wrong" setup:** Name the wrong approach before teaching the right one. Structure: `most people [do wrong thing] -> they think [specific wrong approach] -> here's what actually works`
- **Confidence:** No hedging. Absolute statements. "It completely rewired my brain" not "I feel like it helped." No "maybe," "perhaps," or "consider."
- **Short paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences max. Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.
- **Rhythm variation:** Alternate between very short punches ("You need a system.") and longer flowing multi-clause sentences. Break predictable cadence.
- **Person shifts:** Move between "I" (personal experience), "you" (direct instruction), and "we" (shared journey).
- **No filler:** Cut "basically," "essentially," "in order to," "it's worth noting," "it's important to note." Every word earns its place.
- **Tone:** Mentor who's slightly ahead of you, not professor looking down. Peer energy with authority substance.

### Structure (Dan Koe Articulation Frameworks)

- **Pyramid principle:** Lead with the key conclusion, then support it. Answer first, evidence second.
- **Cross-domain synthesis:** Pull patterns from unrelated fields to make ideas stick (e.g., entropy from physics to explain context degradation).
- **Idea Legos when expanding a point:** Cycle through pain point, example, personal story, metaphor, reframe.

### Persuasion & Quotability (TheBeautyOfSaaS Patterns)

- **No hedging:** Declarative statements. Everything stated as fact. No "maybe" or "consider."
- **Quotable one-liners:** Every major section should produce at least one standalone sentence worth saving or screenshotting.
- **Named frameworks with labels:** Give concepts sticky names (e.g., "The Copy-Paste Reset," "The Context Engineering Stack"). Makes ideas shareable.
- **Math-based proof when possible:** Hard numbers beat abstract claims. "1 hr/day x 3 days/week = 144 hrs/year" is harder to argue with than "significant time investment."

## AI Patterns to Remove

### Inflated Importance
Cut: "stands as a testament to," "pivotal moment," "evolving landscape," "indelible mark," "significant shift," "setting the stage for," "deeply rooted in," "at a fundamental level"

### Promotional Tone
Cut: "seamless," "cutting-edge," "state-of-the-art," "robust," "comprehensive," "holistic," "dynamic," "vibrant," "game-changer"

### Empty Analysis
Cut: "...emphasizing the significance of," "...highlighting the importance of," "...underscoring the need for," "...demonstrating the value of"

### AI Vocabulary
Cut: "delve into," "leverage," "unlock the potential," "in today's world," "at the end of the day," "best practices," "paradigm shift," "paradigm," "it's worth noting," "it's important to note," "dive deep"

### Em Dash Overuse
Limit to one per paragraph max. Replace most with commas, parentheses, or periods.

### Rule of Three
Vary list lengths. Use 2, 4, or 5 instead of always 3.

### Excessive Transitions
Use "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally," "However" sparingly. One per 3-4 paragraphs max.

### Bolded List Syndrome
Convert "**Term**: explanation that repeats the term" into natural prose or tighter bullets.

### Uniform Sentence Length
Mix short punchy statements with longer explanatory ones. Break predictable rhythm.

## Human Voice to Add

- **Have opinions.** React to information, don't just report it.
- **Use specifics.** "Took me four days" beats "required significant effort."
- **Show messy thinking.** Include false starts, changed minds, lessons learned.
- **Vary rhythm.** Short sentence. Then a longer one that builds on the idea with more context.
- **Admit uncertainty where genuine.** "I think," "probably," "haven't fully tested this."
- **Include failures.** Real projects have mistakes. Mention them.
- **Use contractions.** "don't" not "do not" unless emphasis matters.

## What to Preserve

- Factual accuracy and technical details
- Code blocks and examples
- Original intent and meaning
- Frontmatter and metadata
- Appropriate tone for context (technical docs can be more formal)
- Never introduce fabricated statistics, quotes, or data points during voice polish. Polishing cannot add specifics that weren't in the original — no invented percentages, fake client names, or fictional testimonials.

## Self-Check

Before finishing, verify:

- Would a person actually say this?
- Are there specific details or just generic claims?
- Can I feel someone behind these words?
- Does every sentence sound the same length?
- Would I keep reading this?
- Does every major section have at least one quotable standalone line?
- Does every section ending pull the reader into what comes next?

If "no" to any — keep editing.
