# Text Humanizer

Remove AI writing patterns and add authentic human voice to any text content.

## When to Use

- Blog posts or articles lacking personality
- Marketing copy that sounds like a brochure
- Documentation that feels robotic
- Emails that are too formal or stiff
- Social media posts that sound generic
- Reports or proposals with corporate buzzwords
- Any content flagged as "AI-sounding"

## AI Patterns to Remove

### 1. Inflated Importance
Cut: "stands as a testament to," "pivotal moment," "evolving landscape," "indelible mark," "significant shift," "setting the stage for," "deeply rooted in"

### 2. Promotional Tone
Cut: "seamless," "cutting-edge," "state-of-the-art," "robust," "comprehensive," "holistic," "dynamic," "vibrant," "breathtaking," "game-changer"

### 3. Empty Analysis
Cut: "...emphasizing the significance of," "...highlighting the importance of," "...underscoring the need for," "...demonstrating the value of"

### 4. Em Dash Overuse
Limit to one per paragraph max. Replace most with commas, parentheses, or periods.

### 5. Rule of Three
Vary list lengths. Not everything needs exactly three items. Use 2, 4, or 5 instead.

### 6. AI Vocabulary
Cut: "It's important to note," "It's worth noting," "dive deep," "delve into," "leverage," "unlock the potential," "in today's world," "at the end of the day," "best practices," "paradigm shift"

### 7. Excessive Transitions
Use sparingly (one per 3-4 paragraphs): "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally," "However," "Nevertheless," "In addition"

### 8. Bolded List Syndrome
Convert "**Term**: explanation that repeats the term" format into natural prose or tighter bullets.

### 9. Uniform Sentence Length
Mix short punchy statements with longer explanatory ones. Break predictable rhythm.

## Add Human Voice

- **Have opinions.** React to information, don't just report it.
- **Use specifics.** "Took me four days" beats "required significant effort."
- **Show messy thinking.** Include false starts, changed minds, lessons learned.
- **Vary rhythm.** Short sentence. Then a longer one that builds on the idea with more context.
- **Admit uncertainty.** "I think," "probably," "seems like," "haven't fully tested this."
- **Include failures.** Real projects have mistakes. Mention them.
- **Use contractions.** Write "don't" not "do not" unless emphasis matters.

## What to Preserve

- Factual accuracy
- Technical details
- Code blocks and examples
- Original intent and meaning
- Appropriate tone for context (technical docs can be more formal)
- Never introduce fabricated statistics, quotes, or data points during humanization. If the source text contains unverified claims, flag them rather than polishing them.

## Self-Check

Ask yourself:
- Would a person actually say this?
- Are there specific details or just generic claims?
- Can I feel someone behind these words?
- Does every sentence sound the same length?
- Would I keep reading this?

If "no" to any — keep editing.
